We aim to build a community of self-assured, career-focused and world-class women researchers in IndiaÂ across different STEM fields, by fostering a culture of inclusiveness and cooperation.

In order to realise this goal, our platform is committed to
1. promote collaboration among women researchers across different STEM fields, to revive and significantly contribute to our rich scientific heritage.
2. nurture women researchers who are under-resourced or are from minority groups, and providing resources that aid in their upliftment and career growth.
3. foster future generations of women passionate about STEM research, by helping young researchers easily find abundance of inspiration and time-tested guidance.
